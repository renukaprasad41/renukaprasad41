 Buffering
✓ Messages exchanged by communicating processes reside in a temporary queue, and such 
queues can be implemented in one of three ways,
1. Zero capacity – Maximum length is zero and sender must wait for the receiver.
2. Bounded capacity – finite length of n messages, sender must wait if link isfull.
3. Unbounded capacity – infinite length and sender never waits.
