Multilevel Queue Scheduling
 Thisisusedfortheprocesseswhichcanbeclassifiedintodifferentgroups
 A multilevel Queue scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue into 
several separate queues. The processes are permanently assigned to one 
queue based on some priority.
 Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
Ex: separate queues might be used for foreground and background 
processes. The foreground queue might be scheduled by an RR algorithm, 
while the background queue is scheduled by an FCFS algorithm.
 There must be scheduling among the queues.
 Ex: Five queues are listed below in the order of priority .
o System processes
o Interactive processes
o Interactive editing processes
o Batch processes
