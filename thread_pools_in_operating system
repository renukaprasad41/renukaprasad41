Idea behind a thread pool is to create a number of threads at process startup and place 
them into a pool, where they sit and wait for work.
 When a server receives a quest, it awakens a thread from this pool- if one is available
 Server passes the request to this thread
 Once the thread completes its service, it returns to the pool and awaits more work.
 If the pool contains no available thread, the server waits until one becomes free.
 Advantages of thread pools are-
 Servicing a request with an existing thread is usually faster than waiting to create a 
thread.
 A thread pool limits the number of threads that exist at anyone point.
