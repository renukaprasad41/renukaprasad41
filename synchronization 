 Synchronization
✓ Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking. Blocking is considered
synchronous. Non-blocking is considered asynchronous.
o Blocking send: The sending process is blocked until the message is received by the 
receiving process or by the mailbox.
o Non-blocking send: The sending process sends the message and resumes operation.
o Blocking receive: The receiver blocks until a message is available.
o Non-blocking receive: The receiver retrieves either a valid message or a null.
