 A thread library provides the programmer an API for creating and managing threads.
There are two primary ways of implementing a thread library.
 The first approach is to provide a library entirely in user space with no kernel support. 
All code and data structures for the library exist in user space.
 The second approach is to implement a kernel-level library supported directly by the 
operating system.
 Three main thread libraries are in use today:
1. POSIX threads
2. Win32
3. Java threads
 POSIX standard threads or Pthreads maybe provided as user or kernel level library.
 Win32 thread library is a kernel-level library available on windows systems.
 Java thread API allows threads creation and management directly in java program
