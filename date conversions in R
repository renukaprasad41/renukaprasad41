Date Conversions
In CSV files the dates will be normally stored as strings and they have to be converted 
into date and time using any of the packages. For this we need to parse the strings 
using the function strptime() and this returns the date of the format POSIXlt. 
The date format is specified as a string and passed as argument to the strptime()
function. If the given string does not match the format given in the format string, 
then it returns NA.
> date1 <- strptime(“22:15:45 22/08/2015”, “%H:%M:%S %d/%m/%Y”)
> date1
[1] “2015-08-22 22:15:45 IST”
> date2 <- strptime(“22:15:45 22/08/2015”, “%H:%M:%S %d-%m-%Y”)
> date2
[1] NA
In the format string “%H” denotes hour in 24 hour system, “%M” denotes 
minutes, “%S” denotes second, “%m” denotes the number of the month, “%d”
denotes the day of the month as number, “%Y” denotes four digit year.
To convert a date into a string the function strftime() is used. This function also 
takes a date formatting string as argument like strptime(). In the format string “%I”
denotes hour in 12 hours system, “%p” denotes AM/PM, “%A” denotes the string of 
day of the week, “%B” denotes the string of name of the month.
> strftime(Sys.Date(),”It’s %I:%M%p on %A %d %B, %Y.”)
