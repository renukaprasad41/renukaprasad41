Matrices and Arrays
A matrix is a collection of data elements with the same basic type arranged in a two-
dimensional rectangular layout. An array consists of multidimensional rectangular 
data. Matrices are special cases of two-dimensional arrays. To create an array the 
array() function can be used and a vector of values and vector of dimensions are 
passed to it.
> x <- array(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), 
 dimnames = list(c(“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”), c(“e”, “f ”, “g”), c(“h”, “i”)))
> x
, , h
 e f g
a 1 5 9
b 2 6 10
c 3 7 11
d 4 8 12
, , i
 e f g
a 13 17 21
b 14 18 22
c 15 19 23
d 16 20 24
The syntax for creating matrices is using the function matrix() and passing the 
nrow or ncol argument instead of the dim argument in the arrays. A matrix can also 
be created using the array() function where the dimension of the array is two.
> m <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c(“a”, “b”, “c”), c(“d”, “e”, “f ”, “g”)))
> m
