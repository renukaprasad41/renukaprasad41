BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS
• An Instruction consists of 2 parts, 1) Operation code (Opcode) and 2) Operands.
OPERANDS
• The data/operands are stored in memory. • The individual instruction are brought from the memory to the processor. • Then, the processor performs the specified operation. • Let us see a typical instruction
ADD LOCA, R0
• This instruction is an addition operation. The following are the steps to execute the instruction: 
Step 1: Fetch the instruction from main-memory into the processor.
Step 2: Fetch the operand at location LOCA from main-memory into the processor.
Step 3: Add the memory operand (i.e. fetched contents of LOCA) to the contents of register R0. 
Step 4: Store the result (sum) in R0. • The same instruction can be realized using 2 instructions as:
Load LOCA, R1 
Add R1, R0
• The following are the steps to execute the instruction:
Step 1: Fetch the instruction from main-memory into the processor.
Step 2: Fetch the operand at location LOCA from main-memory into the register R1. 
Step 3: Add the content of Register R1
